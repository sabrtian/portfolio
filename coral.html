        <p class="p-long">Coral bleaching occurs when ocean temperatures become too high or too low, causing the algae living on the coral to leave. This algae is also its main source of food, and without it, the coral turns white. Today, coral reefs are home to 25% of the world’s marine species, provide homes and food to local marine species, and help protect against coastal erosion. As Earth’s temperature is rapidly increasing, coral reefs are slowly disappearing, many of which cannot be recovered at all.

        In this project, I visualized the location and severity of global coral reefs. Each circle’s location corresponds to the coral reef’s longitude and latitude. Each circle is connected to an invisible timeline that maps it to when coral bleaching began at that location, with its color signifying gradual bleaching or bleaching during one of the three global bleaching events in 1998, 2010, or 2014-2017. Circles were  colored yellow, unfilled, or has a range of opacities depending on the severity of bleaching at that site. Data for coral bleaching past 2013 did not specify severity, so they are all marked as unknown.</p>
