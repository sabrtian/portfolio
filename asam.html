        The ASAM Program will host a Fall Colloquium and Spring Speaker Series with the 2021 ASAM Fellowship recipients: Kingsley Song, Lily Suh, Sabrina Tian, and Ziyan Wu. Each Fellow is conducting independent research projects on topics that range from Korean political history, Chinese pension system, the American Dream, and migration data visualizations under the theme of “Reclaiming Narratives.” Their presentations will redefine conversations in the Asian American space by exploring the power dynamics that shape the marginalized narratives that they are uplifting, and they will shift the focus in academia away from the widely projected white viewpoint that obscure histories of racism, colonialism, and erasure. Together, these projects weave together the theme of “Reclaiming Narratives'” and open these perspectives to the community by initiating open conversations about Asian Studies. They will reclaim the central voice of the Asian community across both history and the present, and reframe the American perspective according to the Asian American community’s lived experiences.

        The 2021 ASAM Fellowship logo consists of open quotation marks to symbolize the conversations their research projects will initiate. Visually, these quotation marks fade in color and swirl into an ellipses to resemble the transparency and honesty of the dialogue, and continued discussion after the Fellowship ends.

        I am researching contemporary data art created within the 20th century to visualize global migration patterns from Asia to the U.S. and shift the power dynamic in defining American history and art to tell the narratives of AAPI communities from everyday individuals within.
